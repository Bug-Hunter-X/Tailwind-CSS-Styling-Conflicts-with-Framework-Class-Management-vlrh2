This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework that uses a different way to manage classes or styles. For example, if you're using a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte, they might have their own class name management that could conflict with Tailwind's directives.  This leads to unexpected behavior and styles not applied correctly.  The issue often isn't immediately obvious and can be tricky to trace.
